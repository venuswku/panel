## Create an Environment with Anaconda
Create a new environment named `mypanelintro` with all the required packages by entering the following commands in succession into Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux):\
Skip the command `conda install "ipywidgets<8" -y` if you installed Panel with a version >= `0.14.0`.
```
conda create -n mypanelintro
conda activate mypanelintro
conda install "ipywidgets<8" -y
conda install -c bokeh ipywidgets_bokeh -y
conda install -c conda-forge panel ipyleaflet jupyter -y
```

## Launch Jupyter Notebook as a Web Server
- Make sure your Anaconda environment is activated by running `conda activate mypanelintro` in your terminal.
- Run the command `panel serve --show --autoreload app.ipynb` in your terminal.
- A webpage with the URL http://localhost:5006/app will display all Panel objects marked with `.servable()`.
- Any changes in the notebook will automatically be reflected on the webpage.
- If you installed Panel with a version lower than `0.14.0`, make sure the installed `ipywidgets` package in your environment is lower than version `8.0.1`.
  - See reason for `ipywidgets<8` here: https://github.com/holoviz/panel/issues/3778#issue-1349757718.
  - Check the version of your installed packages by running `conda list`.
